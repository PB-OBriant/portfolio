The site showcases my projects, resume, and background in **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, with a focus on clean design, responsive layout, and modern front-end practices.

## 🧠 Design & Implementation Notes

- The navigation bar uses React state (`useState`) to manage mobile menu visibility.
- Routing is handled with `react-router-dom` to enable smooth, reload-free navigation.
- Styling is written manually in CSS to maintain full control over layout and visual hierarchy.
- Components are kept small and focused to support scalability and maintainability.
